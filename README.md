This is my Final Year Project. 
DataCollection.ipynb is for collecting YouTube video metadata and daily engagement snapshots
CombineData.ipynb is for combining the data collected each day into combined_engagement.csv and combined_youtube.csv
Models_Codes.ipynb is where all the models are trained and the results for each model is shown
yt_final_with_sentiment.csv is the final dataset after preprocessing in Models_Codes.ipynb
